I am adding a new file to test fetch and pull request

Next I am adding a change from local directory

I am adding this new more line to simulate the clash between local directory update
and github update

I am deleting the clash comment. Thus, this file should work properly now

After creating a sample-branch, I am adding this new line to see confirm the change only exists in the sample-branch;
not in the master branch.
